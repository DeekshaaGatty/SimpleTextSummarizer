# SimpleTextSummarizer
Implementing a frequency-based technique for summarizing text :
This repository contains a Python script that utilizes a frequency-based approach to generate summaries of text. The script reads text from a file, applies tokenization and frequency analysis, and generates a condensed summary based on the most important sentences. It can be used for automatic text summarization tasks or as a starting point for further development in natural language processing.
