To execute the summarizer code, you will need the following requirements:

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. NLTK Library: The code utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for text processing. To install NLTK, you can use the following command:

   ```
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. NLTK Data: NLTK requires additional data files to perform certain tasks such as tokenization and stop word removal. To download the required data, you can use the following code in a Python shell:

   ```
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

4. Text File: You need a text file to summarize. Make sure you have a text file with the content you want to summarize. Provide the correct file name when prompted by the script.
